Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing state-of-the-art machine learning solutions, including deep learning and generative AI models for various applications such as computer vision, event detection, and natural language processing.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about multimodal foundational models and large language models (LLMs), with a focus on applying low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on innovative ML projects, especially those involving RFID technology, phased array antennas, and wireless communication systems.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with exploring new job opportunities in multimodal foundational models and LLMs.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning, RF modeling, phased array antennas, or anything related to electromagnetic simulations.
